# Yatzy
A simple game of Yatzy made with WPF as a practice project.

I made this project after having completed the Udemy course "Complete C# Masterclass", as a way to gain experience working with WPF.  
I later refactored the code after having completed the Udemy course "C# Developers: Learn the Art of Writing Clean Code".

What I Learned:
- Using lists to store and sort the result of a dice roll to simplify the conditional statements required to determine if the player scored their chosen result, for example a Full House.
